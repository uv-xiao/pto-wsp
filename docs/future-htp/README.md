# HTP Redo (docs-only) — Index

This folder is the **redo design** described by `docs/future/REDO.md`.

## Read order

- `docs/future-htp/analysis.md` — positioning and methodology (WHY)
- `docs/future-htp/features.md` — feature catalog (WHAT)
- `docs/future-htp/implementations.md` — architecture and contracts (HOW)
- `docs/future-htp/examples.md` — end-to-end examples

## Deep dives

- Features: `docs/future-htp/feats/`
- Implementation components: `docs/future-htp/impls/`

## Scope note

This redo is **docs-only**: it does not rename packages, move code, or change build scripts yet.
