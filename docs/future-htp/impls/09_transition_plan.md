# Impl: Transition Plan (docs-only in this redo)

This redo intentionally produces **design documents only** under `docs/future-htp/`.

Future execution plan (not performed here):

- rename repository/module from `pto-wsp` to `htp`
- preserve backward compatibility via shims for a deprecation window
- migrate examples and docs
- land backend-by-backend using artifact contract tests
