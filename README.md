# HTP (Heterogeneous Tile Programming) — Docs Branch

This is an **orphan docs-only** branch that contains:

- The HTP redo design: `docs/future-htp/`
- Research and reference notes: `docs/research/`, `docs/reference/`
- Historical PTO-WSP v9/v10 design docs (reference only): `docs/reference/pto-wsp/`
- External reference checkouts (gitignored): `references/` (including `references/pto-runtime/`)

No PTO-WSP implementation code is kept on this branch.

## Start here

- `docs/future-htp/README.md`
